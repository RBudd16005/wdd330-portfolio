            <h4>Chapter 08: Transforms and Transitions</h4>
            The CSS3 transform property can rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.<br>
            Elements can be manipulated using transform functions. <br>
            Translation functions can move elements left, right, up, or down.<br>
            These functions are like the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left,<br>
            moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes. <br>
            The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.<br>
            If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values.
            The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.<br>
            As with scale, by default the point of origin is the elementâ€™s center. <br>
            The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.<br>
            The x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis.<br>
            The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.<br>
            The transition-timing-function can control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.<br>
            CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.<br>

            <h4>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h4>
            The first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page.<br>
            The canvas element takes both a width and height attribute, which must also be set. <br>
            The context is the place where the drawing is rendered.<br>
            Both strokeStyle and fillStyle are set on a context object, and both take one of three values: a string representing a color, a CanvasGradient object, or a CanvasPattern object.<br>
            toDataURL creates a URL with the image in it. Right-click the image at this URL and save it as a PNG or JPEG.<br>
