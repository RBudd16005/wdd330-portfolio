Comments are odd because they seem like more work that does not do anything by the code.<br>
They are important for helping others understand your code faster.<br>
Comments do not have to be long.<br>
<br>
// Single line comment<br>
/* Multi line<br>
   comment */<br>
   <br>
C-style syntax used by JavaScript<br>
<br>
Example of Javascript:<br>
const message = 'Hello World!'<br>
alert(message)<br>
<br>
also: const message = 'Hello World!';alert(message);<br>
<br>
Block code is used with '{}' and does not need an ending semi-colon.<br>
<br>
There are reserved words for functions in Javascript that cannot be used as variable names:<br>
abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface<br>
let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield<br>
<br>
also do not use: undefined, NaN, Infinity<br>
<br>
Seven datatypes: String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null<br>
<br>
Typeof will show what the varialbe is:<br>
typeof 'hello'<br>
<< 'string'<br>
<br>
const and let are block scope varialbes that only work in the block they are declared in.<br>
<br>
Try to avoid Global Scope variables.<br>
<br>
Do not start variables with numbers and avoid starting with underscores unless the variable is private, also try to avoid starting with $.<br>
<br>
Variable names are case sensitive.<br>
<br>
Be consistant with your naming rules.<br>
<br>
Variables started with '{}' mean it is a referance and not the value itself:<br>
const c = { value: 1 };<br>
let d = c; // c.value = 1, d.value = 1<br>
d.value = 2; // c.value = 2, d.value = 2<br>
<br>
use ' and " as needed if you want a ' or a " in the string:<br>
'it's me' = error<br>
"it's me' = good!<br>
This also works: 'it\'s me'<br>
<br>
string.toUpperCase() = change all characters to upper case<br>
string.toLowerCase() = change all characters to lower case<br>
find characters by index: name.charAt(0)<br>
                         << 'w'<br>
find index by character: string.indexOf('w')<br>
                         << 0<br>
        </p>
