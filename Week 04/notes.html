            <h1>Chapter 08: Forms</h1>
            <h3> Accessing Form Elements </h3>
            Forms are a main component of Google's home page.<br>
            Forms are now more frequently processed on the front end before it is sent to a server. <br>
            doument.forms returns an HTML collection of all the forms in athe document in the order they appear in the markup. <br>
            A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form. <br>
            The input field has a name attribute of searchInput and can be accessed using code. <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Form Properties and Methods</h3>
            The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. This will not trigger the form submit event. <br>
            <h3>Form Events</h3>
            The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. <br>
            The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element. <br>
            The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it. <br>
            <h3>Submitting a Form</h3>
            You can stop the form from being submitted to the URL by using the preventDefault() function. <br>
            <h3>Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form</h3>
            Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field. <br>
            Similar results can be produced in modern browsers by using the placeholder attribute in the HTML markup. <br>
            <h3>Form Controls</h3>
            Common types of form control are: <br>
            input - These are fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads. <br>
            select - These are menus for drop-down lists of options. <br>
            textarea - These are elements for longer text entry. <br>
            button - These are elements for submitting and resetting forms. <br>
            <h3>Radio Button Input Fields</h3>
            Radio buttons are created using input fields with type='radio'. <br>
            Like checkboxes they allow users to check an option as true, but they provide an exclusive choice of options, <br>
            so only one option can be selected. <br>
            <h3>Hidden Input Fields</h3>
            Hidden fields can be created using input fields with type='hidden'. <br>
            These are not displayed by the browser, but have a 'value' attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form. <br>
            They are often used to send information such as settings or information that the user has already provided. <br>
            The information in these fields is not a secret, as it’s visible in the HTML, so shouldn’t be used for sensitive data. <br>
            <h3>File Input Fields</h3>
            A file input field can be created using input fields with type='file'. <br>
            These are used to upload files. <br>
            <h3>Other Input Types</h3>
            There are new input types included in HTML5: number, tel, and color. <br>
            <h3>Form Validation</h3>
            Form validation is checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly or not. <br>
            The API works by simply adding relevant attributes to the form fields. <br>
            For example, if a field is a required field that must be filled in, all you need to do is add a <br>
            'required' attribute to that field and the browser will take care of the rest. <br>
            <h3>Disabling the Submit Button</h3>
            A useful technique is to disable the submit button if there are errors on the form. <br>
            If the submit button is disabled then no action is taken when it is clicked. <br>
            This can be changed by using the disabled property of the button. <br>

            <h3>Constructor Functions</h3>
            The parentheses are not required when instantiating a new object using a constructor function. <br>

            <h3>Advantage and Disadvantages of Libraries</h3>
            Libraries are well tested. <br>
            There will be lots of online help in using them. <br>
            Disadvantages to libraries include, using other peoples code along with your own, this adds size to your files. <br>
            Some libraries will not perform the way you want them to. <br>
            Code may also run slower. <br>
